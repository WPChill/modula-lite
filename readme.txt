## How to Create a Photo Gallery in WordPress

Creating a photo gallery with Modula is simple. Start by installing the plugin from your WordPress dashboard. Navigate to Modula in your admin menu and click "Add New." Upload your images using the media uploader or drag and drop files directly into the gallery builder.

Once your images are uploaded, choose your gallery type. For a custom layout, select Custom Grid and drag images to resize them. For an automatic layout, choose Masonry which arranges images in a Pinterest-style layout.

Customize your gallery settings including spacing, borders, shadows, and hover effects. Configure your lightbox options to control how images display when clicked. Set up responsive breakpoints to ensure your gallery looks perfect on mobile devices.

Copy the shortcode provided and paste it into any post, page, or widget where you want your gallery to appear. Your responsive image gallery is now live on your website.

## How to Add a Gallery to Your WordPress Sidebar

Adding an image gallery to your WordPress sidebar or widget area is straightforward. After creating your gallery in Modula, copy the shortcode. Navigate to Appearance > Widgets in your WordPress admin panel.

Add a "Shortcode" widget to your desired sidebar location. Paste your Modula gallery shortcode into the widget. The gallery will automatically resize to fit your sidebar width while maintaining responsive behavior.

For optimal sidebar display, consider using fewer images or adjusting the gallery's column settings to ensure images don't appear too small on desktop devices.

## How to Create a Masonry Gallery Layout

Masonry galleries arrange images in a flowing, Pinterest-style layout that makes efficient use of space. Images of different sizes fit together like a puzzle without leaving gaps.

To create a masonry image gallery, select "Masonry" as your gallery type when creating a new gallery. Upload images of various dimensions for the most dynamic effect. The masonry layout automatically positions images to create a balanced, visually appealing grid.

Adjust the gutter spacing between images to control how tightly packed your masonry gallery appears. Configure the number of columns for different screen sizes to ensure your gallery remains responsive on mobile devices.

## How to Add Videos to Your Image Gallery

With Modula Pro, you can create video galleries that combine videos with photos. This is perfect for event galleries, portfolio websites, and multimedia presentations.

To add videos to your gallery, click the "Add new" button when adding new items to your gallery. Paste YouTube or Vimeo URLs, or upload self-hosted video files. Videos appear inline with your images and open in the lightbox viewer when clicked.

Mix video content with photos to create engaging multimedia galleries that tell a complete story. Video thumbnails are generated automatically (for YouTube & Vimeo videos) for a seamless viewing experience.

## Creating Portfolio Galleries for Photography Websites

Photographers need portfolio galleries that showcase their work professionally. Modula provides the tools to create stunning photography portfolios that impress potential clients.

Use the Custom Grid gallery type to create curated layouts that highlight your best work. Resize key images to draw attention to your strongest photographs. Add captions and titles to provide context for each image.

Enable the lightbox slideshow feature to let visitors browse your photography in full-screen mode. Disable right-click protection to prevent unauthorized downloading of your photos. Add watermarks to protect your intellectual property while still showcasing your portfolio.

## Building Real Estate Photo Galleries

Real estate agents use photo galleries to showcase property listings. Modula makes it easy to create professional real estate galleries that help properties sell faster - especially with our dedicated BnB layout.

Upload photos of each room, exterior shots, and neighborhood amenities. Use gallery filters to let visitors sort by room type or property feature. Add detailed captions describing each space and highlighting key selling points.

Create separate galleries for each property listing and organize them into albums. This allows potential buyers to easily browse multiple properties on your website.

## Using Modula with WooCommerce Product Galleries

Enhance your WooCommerce store with better product galleries. Replace default WooCommerce product images with custom Modula galleries that showcase products from multiple angles.

Create a gallery for each product with detailed product shots, lifestyle images, and close-up details. Use hover effects to make product galleries interactive. Enable the lightbox to let customers view high-resolution product images.

Product galleries with multiple images increase conversion rates by giving customers confidence in what they're purchasing.

## How to Optimize Gallery Images for SEO

Image SEO is crucial for getting your photos discovered in Google Image Search. Modula's AI optimizer makes image SEO easy by automatically generating optimized titles, captions, and ALT text.

Use descriptive filenames before uploading images. Include relevant keywords in image ALT text to help search engines understand your photos. Write detailed captions that provide context and include keywords naturally.

Enable lazy loading to improve page speed, which is a ranking factor for SEO. Compress images before uploading to reduce file sizes without sacrificing quality. Well-optimized image galleries can drive significant organic traffic from image search results.

## Troubleshooting Common Gallery Issues

### Why is my gallery not displaying properly?

If your image gallery isn't showing up on your page, first verify the shortcode is correctly placed. Check that the gallery ID in the shortcode matches your gallery. Clear your browser cache and any WordPress caching plugins.

Inspect your browser console for JavaScript errors that might prevent the gallery from loading. Ensure there are no theme conflicts by temporarily switching to a default WordPress theme to test.

### How do I fix blurry images in my gallery?

Blurry images typically result from the "Gallery image size" setting being too low. Navigate to your gallery settings and increase the "Minimum Image Width" value in the General section.

Upload higher resolution source images to provide better quality at larger display sizes. The plugin resizes images based on your settings, so starting with high-quality originals ensures sharp results.

### Gallery images not loading on mobile devices

Mobile loading issues are often caused by JavaScript conflicts or caching problems. Disable lazy loading temporarily to see if that resolves the issue. Check that your mobile theme doesn't conflict with gallery scripts.

Ensure responsive breakpoints are properly configured in your gallery settings. Test on multiple mobile devices and browsers to identify if the issue is device-specific or universal.

### How to speed up slow gallery loading times

Just use Modula SpeedUP and we'll handle everything else. We'll optimize your images through ShortPixel, and send them off to a super fast CDN. The process runs in the background seamlessly and you don't have to do anything besides activate the Modula SpeedUP extension.

Reduce the number of images per gallery page or implement gallery pagination. Use a CDN to serve images faster to visitors worldwide. Optimize your WordPress hosting for better overall performance.

### Images appearing in wrong order in gallery

Gallery image order is controlled in the gallery builder. Drag and drop images to reorder them in your desired sequence. The display order matches the order shown in the gallery editor.

If using Masonry layout, note that image positions adjust automatically based on available space and image dimensions. For precise control over image placement, use Custom Grid layout instead.
