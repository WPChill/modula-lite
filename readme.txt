The WordPress gallery plugin that's highlighy customizable & you can use to impress your clients. Create beautiful image galleries in minutes.

== Description ==

Impress your potential clients with a fully customizable WordPress gallery plugin that's fully mobile responsive, doesn't slow down your website and doesn't require a single line of code to work.  

If you're tired of lacking control over how your galleries end up looking, the bad image cropping, the lack of control over your photos, videos and how they look on mobile devices - you don't have to look any further. 

Modula **fixes all of the above** and more. Read on to see what we're all about.

**the author was also very responsive with support**
>I had been searching for a gallery that lets me decide the size/cropping for EACH image. This cool plugin does exactly that!

**I don’t often leave reviews, but I really love Modula!**
>I’m a HUGE fan of the free Modula and the Pro version is WAY more amazing. I haven’t had any problems and I am confident their support would be responsive if I did. 

>Another happy Modula user. 

= Even more happy Modula users =
>1. I really like the plugin and would recommend to anyone want to create a cool gallery! Great and quick customer support, thank you for helping me solve problem!
>2. I had paid good money for the leading gallery plugin. But it didn’t create links of the photos so I could send people to a shopping cart for that image. Modula does. BIG advantage. Plus the customer service is top notch. Thanks Modula!
>3. There is a lot of gallery plugins but for some reason, they are not 100% masonry – they layout the photos often in an ugly way, and not at an even height. This plugin makes a perfect masonry, what is the main reason I use it.

**SOME MODULA DEMO APPLICATIONS / USAGES**

Not sure if Modula is the right gallery plugin for you? We encourage you to take a look at other gallery plugins, but one thing you'll notice is that **they all look the same...**

**Sick and tired of boring galleries? Make your own and stand out with Modula.** 
Galleries created with Modula don't always look identical. With the Modula custom grid functionality, you can easily adjust the size and aspect ratio of each individual image by dragging from the bottom right-hand corner in the gallery edit area. 
Custom grids give you greater flexibility over how you display the images on your website. Easily control the size and look of your gallery - choosing the images you want to stand out, rather than relying on an algorithm.
Yes, that means you don't have to worry about your gallery awkwardly cropping out your subject or your subject not being at the center of the image.

**Modula is the most powerful, customizable and easy-to-use WordPress gallery plugin** available because we give you the power to choose everything from the height and width of your gallery down to resizing individual images within the container that makes sure your images never exceed the content area. 

**Ease-of-use shouldn't mean sample/basic Galleries**
Modula has been designed to be user-friendly from the ground up so that users of varying WordPress experience can easily create the perfect WordPress photo, video and image galleries. 
If you don't want all the customization features, you can leave everything up to the algorithm, and if you do - they're there so you can easily choose gallery size, margins between images, the color and size of captions. 
If you can't seem to figure something out, you can always check our [documentation](https://wp-modula.com/docs) or [get in touch](https://wp-modula.com/contact-us) - we're always happy to help...

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The layout doesn't look correct =
Check the console of the browser and look if you see any error like: "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function" 
This errors means that the browser doesn't know the Modula JavaScript plugin, most of the time the problem is caused by a wrong jQuery inclusion by the theme or another plugin. 
= Why does some image look blurry ? =
If you get blurry and pixellated images then you need to raise the "Minimum image width" parameter inside the "General" section.
= I want to use another lightbox instead of the provided one =
That is no longer officially supported. However, we do offer a freely downloadable lightbox extension that brings back support for 5 more lighboxes. You can read more about it [here](https://wp-modula.com/modula-230/)
