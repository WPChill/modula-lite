= Some Modula demo applications / usages  =

Do you wonder why this gallery is the best one? Look at the other galleries, see their demos, you’ll notice something weird ... THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME! 

Modula is creative! Modula is dynamic! Modula doesn’t always look the same. Just have fun with it! Modula uses a new concept to build its internal grid. After you set a width and a height for the gallery, Modula will create a random but smart grid inside. The result is a dynamic, creative, interesting and attractive gallery.

You can control how much randomness to use in each gallery, so you can obtain a more traditional layout by switching off the “random factor,” or you can make something much more different by incrementing this factor.

Modula is a justified grid gallery because YOU decide the width and the height of the gallery, and the images to put inside. Modula will think about everything else. Images will never exceed their container.

To achieve such a result, images will be cropped, but that’s not a problem at all, because you can set a custom alignment for those images where the subject is not at the center of the image.

Modula Grid Gallery is not only responsive but also fluid, which means you’ll see images organize themselves with an impressive animation even on mobile devices thanks to the CSS3 engine.

**Ease of use doesn’t mean trivial galleries, indeed!**
By using the Modula Admin Panel you’re able to fine tune every aspect of the gallery. Choose a gallery size, margins between images, the color and the size of captions. Each photo can have a title and a subtitle so you’re able to best describe every image.

= What is Modula good for? =

Modula is also the best WordPress portfolio plugin, as it allows you to build gorgeous, creative portfolios. Applications are: 

* architecture
* art
* photography
* food blogs
* pets and animals
* tattoos
* travel
* also wedding albums.

If you're frustated because your current galleries looks boring and too standard then you can use the importer which is included with Modula. The importer is currently able to import Envira and NextGen galleries.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The layout doesnt' look correct =

Check the console of the browser and look if you see any error like: "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function" 
This errors means that the browser doesn't know the Modula JavaScript plugin, most of the time the problem is caused by a wrong jQuery inclusion by the theme or another plugin. 

= Why does some image look blurry ? =

If you get blurry and pixellated images then you need to raise the "Minimum image width" parameter inside the "General" section.

= I want to use another lightbox instead of the provided one =

The PRO license bundles 6 different lightboxes. However you can use any other lightbox you want also with the Lite license. If you have installed a lightbox plugin then you just need to select "Direct link to image" in the "Lightbox" settings.

= How can I get support? =
